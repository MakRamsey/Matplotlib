# Matplotlib

Greetings!

Welcome to the Matplotlib repository. Within this project, a performance analysis was conducted on behalf of a hypothetical pharmaceutical company for their anti-cancer medication portfolio. In the study, 249 mice who were identified with Squamous Cell Carcinoma tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens and over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. Executed Python code leveraging Matplotlib, Pandas and ScipyStats was utilized for Data preparation, summary statistic/visualization generation and a subsequent top-level report (contained within initial markdown cell). Raw data was supplied via 2 CSV files, one including mouse metadata and the other including study results.

**Repository Structure:**

  - 'Pymaceuticals' directory:
    
    - 'data' directory:
      - "Mouse_metadata.csv"
      - "Study_results.csv"
     
    - "Pymaceuticals.ipynb" - Executed analysis code and top-level summary


Cheers!
